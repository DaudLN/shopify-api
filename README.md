To authenticate and make API calls, you need to use JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication.

User Registration and Login
---------------------------

This feature ensures that users can manage their data, maintain session state, and perform actions within the API according to their specific permissions and privileges.

Caching with Redis Cache Server
-------------------------------

We utilize Redis Cache server for caching, which offers several benefits:

* Improved performance by reducing database queries and network round-trips.
* Enhanced scalability as cached data can be quickly served to multiple users.
* Reduced load on the backend system, leading to better overall system performance.
* Efficient handling of frequently accessed data, resulting in faster response times.

Advantages of Real REST API Architecture
----------------------------------------

The API follows the principles of a real REST (Representational State Transfer) architecture, providing the following advantages:

* Scalability and extensibility through resource-based design and statelessness.
* Uniform interface for easy integration and development.
* Separation of concerns with clear client-server communication.
* Support for multiplerepresentations of data (e.g., JSON, XML), allowing flexibility for different clients.
* Cacheability of responses for improved performance and reduced server load.
* Support for hypermedia-driven navigation, enabling clients to discover and interact with resources dynamically.

Interaction with Postgres Database
----------------------------------

The API interacts with a Postgres database, providing several benefits for data management and scalability:

* Relational database structure for efficient and organized storage of data.
* ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties for data integrity and transactional operations.
* Advanced querying capabilities, including powerful joins and aggregations.
* Scalability through horizontal and vertical scaling options, allowing for increased workload and user base.
* Data consistency and reliability, ensuring that information remains accurate and available.
